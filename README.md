This is a program to reconstruct the copy protection for _Jet Set Willy_ (1984) for the ZX Spectrum.

It accompanies the paper

  J. Aycock and A. Reinhard. Copy protection in _Jet Set Willy_: [Developing methodology for retrogame archaeology](https://doi.org/10.11141/ia.45.2).
  _Internet Archaeology_, 2017.
  
The script was written for Python 2.x, although converting the `print` statements into `print` functions should
make it runnable under Python 3.x.  To run it:
```
  % python jswdecode.py
```
